                    <br />
                    Write your heart out and let go of the pain.

                    Emotions should be let out - not repressed. But talking your heart and mind out can be tough
                    sometimes. So here's Sleepy Head - a quiet safe place to write your deepest thoughts and words,
                    things that you could never say.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Before you continue, remember our unspoken rule that everyone follows:
                    <br />
                    ‚ùùWhat happens in here, stays in here‚ùû.

                    <p>
                        I built this platform for people suffering from anxiety, depression and stress, people who have
                        been holding back a lot within themselves but can't let their thoughts and emotions out due to
                        some reason or the other: <br />
                        - having no one to understand or speak to <br />
                        - avoiding painful situations <br />
                        - feeling that things have messed up and it's better to stay quiet. <br /> <br />
                        How wonderful it'd be in such cases to have a place where you can release your emotional
                        baggage, where you can write your heart out without fearing anything. <br /> <br />
                        Your posts will not be public, nor anonymous - unless you choose so. Much like instagram's
                        follow system, your friends, families and complicated ones can find your profile by using the
                        search option and send you a 'listener request' (they also need to be registered as a Sleepy
                        Head). If you accept the request, they'll be notified everytime you post a new story and they'd
                        be able to read 'em. This way, you silently tell them your stories without directly talking to
                        them :)<br /><br />One promise that we all Sleepy Heads take while signing up to this platform
                        is that we'd never discuss each others' stories outside this website. Whatever happens here,
                        stays here, safe and sound :)

                                Setting up a profile is one crucial task. From spotify to favourite movies to your
                                socials, there are quite some fields you'll have to fill in, but trust me - you'll love
                                your profile page once created. üòâ

                                stories. Keep a check on your listeners request too. If I were you, I'd only keep the
                                closest of friends as my listeners. ü´†

                                and feel them? üôÇ
